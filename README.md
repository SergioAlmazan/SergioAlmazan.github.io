# SergioAlmazan.github.io
This is Sergio Almazan's portfolio page. I made the main page with updated background with a greeting and my name. I also have a navbar that lets you navigate to the other sections of the page. Which contain the about me and projects. I'm still in the process of the developing my skills in web development so there might be some issue, but I'll continue to build on new skills that'll go into making this site more dynamic and over all better appealing. 

Here's a screenshot of my profile page:
