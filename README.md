This is Sergio Almazan portfolio page. I made a the main you see a cool gif with a greeting and my name. I also have a sidebar that lets you navigate to the other sections of the page. Which contain the about me, projects and how to contact me. I'm still in the process of the developing my skills in web development so there might be some issue, but I'll continue to build on new skills that'll go into making this site more dynamic and over all better appealing.
